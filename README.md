This directory contains all the code necessary to recapitulate the analyses
in Mai 2024. 

The data can be downloaded from here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13346017
Unzip the download file. Note the full path to the unzipped files. 

To generate the figures, run the codes in each subdirectory in sorted order
according to their filename. 

Currently, the path to the data is hardcoded in every script. You will have to change that to the path of the downloaded files. TODO: specify this path to data in a single location and every script
should load from that

Requirements:
numpy
scipy
pandas
matplotlib
